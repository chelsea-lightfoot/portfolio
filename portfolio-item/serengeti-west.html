            <h2>Serengeti West Website and Rebranding</h2>

            <div class="full-image"></div>
        </section>

        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>

            <p>Serengeti West had been using the same website for a decade and it was in major need of an update! More than that, they needed an easier to maintain system so they could update and expand the system themselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="process">
            <h2>Process</h2>

            <div id="process-gallery">
                <div class="item-card item1"></div>
                <div class="item-card item2"></div>
            </div>

            <p>After a few meetings with the owner I was able to glean the look and feel they wanted, namely something “light” and “fresh” and “airy”. A lot of their inspiration came from photographer portfolios and wedding websites, so I worked to create a design that felt light and modern.</p>

            <p>I gave the client an initial mockup to get feedback and ensure I was following their vision - and they absolutely loved it. So much so that we only had one round of revisions.</p>

            <p>The true work was in putting together a system they could maintain with little training. I researched options, but I eventually settled on Wordpress. I was very experienced with Wordpress and I knew it could be used by people with varying levels of technical skill. It also allowed for future integration of an ecommerce shop, something the client had expressed wanting in the future.</p>

            <p>I chose a theme called Enfold because it further simplified the editing process by modularizing the content into easy to follow blocks. Enfold also allowed me to create html structure that was hidden to the client - giving them the power to edit the content without fearing they would break the page. Enfold is well supported, so my client could easily keep the website up to date.</p>

            <p>After seeing their website updated and modern, Serengeti West decided to update their logo. The process was similar to designing the website - the client showed me the inspiration they had found and I used that to create various options. This time we had many more options to choose from - but we eventually narrowed it down to using the initials to create a logo inspired by wrought iron logos used in the many wineries in the Central Coast.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <div id="solution-gallery">
                <div class="item-card item1"></div>
                <div class="item-card item2"></div>
                <div class="item-card item3"></div>
            </div>

            <p>It was a relief to Serengeti West to finally have a more modern website as their online presence. They were happy with the look and feel, and I made the setup of the website easy and painless. After the site was launched and ready to hand off to the client I made a series of tutorial videos showing them how to maintain the site themselves.</p>

            <p>I pulled out my limited hand-lettering experience to create the unique logo that the client uses today. While creating the final logo I made sure it would work not only for print - but also in foil stamping on the jewelry boxes they use in the store.</p>

            <p>Two years later and the site is still running smoothly! They recently implemented a shop and it slotted into the design perfectly, just as I had planned. The logo has gotten quite a lot of positive feedback from their customers and it has worked well for all their applications.</p>
