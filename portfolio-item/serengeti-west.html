                <h2>Process</h2>

                <p>Serengeti West had been using the same website for a decade and they were in major need of an update! More than that, they needed a system that would be empower them to update and expand their content themselves.</p>

                <p>In addition, they desired a new, more modern logo. However, they wanted to see the completed website before they made the jump to a full company rebrand.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="process reversed">
            <div class="limit-width">
                <div id="process-gallery">
                    <div class="item-card item1"></div>
                    <div class="item-card item2"></div>
                </div>

                <p>After a few meetings with the owner I was able to glean the look and feel they wanted, namely something "light" and "fresh" and "airy". A lot of their inspiration came from photographer portfolios and wedding websites, so I worked to create a design that felt light and modern.</p>

                <p>I gave the client an initial mockup to get feedback and ensure I was following their vision. They absolutely loved it &mdash; so much so that we only had one round of revisions.</p>

                <p>The true challenge in this project was putting together a system the client could maintain with minimal training. I researched several options, but eventually settled on Wordpress due to the success I had experienced with previous clients who had similar technical abilities. Wordpress also allowed for future integration with an e-commerce shop, a feature in which the client had expressed future interest.</p>

                <p>I chose a Wordpress theme called Enfold because it further simplified the editing process by modularizing the content into easy to follow blocks. Enfold also allowed me to create HTML structure that was hidden to the client &mdash; giving them the power to edit the content without the fear that they would break the page. Enfold has an active support community, so my client could easily keep the website up to date.</p>

                <p>After seeing their updated and modernized website, Serengeti West decided to update their logo as well. We followed the same process that we had successfully used for the website redesign: the client showed me the inspiration they had found and I used that to create various options. This time we had many more options to choose from &mdash; but we eventually narrowed it down to a stylized monogram inspired by wrought iron logos used in the many wineries in the Central Coast.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>

                <p>Serengeti West was relieved to finally have a more modern website. They were happy with the new design, and I was happy with the simplicity of the website setup. When I was ready to hand the website off to the client I made a series of tutorial videos demonstrating how to maintain the website so they could do so themselves .</p>

                <p>I pulled out my limited hand-lettering experience to create the unique logo that the client uses today. While designing the final logo I took care to ensure it would work well on their website, in print, and in foil stamping on the jewelry boxes they use in the store.</p>

                <p>Two years later the site is still running smoothly. They recently integrated a shop into their Wordpress instance, which slotted into the design perfectly &mdash; just as I had planned! The logo has received quite a lot of positive feedback from their customers and it has worked well for all their applications.
