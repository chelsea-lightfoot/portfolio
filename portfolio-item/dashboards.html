            <h2>Problem</h2>

            <p>The homepage of our application was fairly empty, and we didn't have a way for managers of the system to get a quick look at the day to day activity of their company. We had a lot of data saved in the backend that we wanted to surface to the user.</p>

                <div class="item-card item3"></div>
            </div>

            <h2>Process</h2>

            <p>My first step was to talk to engineering about what data was available and what limitations we had. Then I researched the Javascript library we were using for data visualizations on the inner modules of the application so I could understand the limitations there as well. I researched what made a good software dashboard and with a spark of inspiration I went straight into Illustrator to create a prototype.</p>

            <p>Half-way through We had a major priority shift in the company to respond to a new problem - Inxeption had grown to over 200 customers and the small management application we had created was no longer powerful enough. As a part of this new initiative to improve the management application, upper management wanted a place to view relevant data in this management tool quickly and easily. We decided to use my original dashboard project with slightly different data.</p>

            <p>I had many meetings with management to determine what data they wanted to see and what they considered most important. Then I reviewed the data requested with engineering to understand what was actually feasible in the short amount of time given. With that I was able to collaborate with another designer on my team to present the data requested in the design I originally created.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <p>Shown here are the various dashboard designs I created over the course of this project. There are three versions shown here: the original application dashboard, mini dashboards for the application modules, and the management tool overview dashboard that was implemented in the end.</p>

            <p>Along with the look and feel of the basic graphs and tables, I ensured that this design could be easily updated over time as needs changed and the product expanded. I chose to work in some future vision as well, such as showing notifications and a percentage of completion graph for the products dashboard &mdash; a feature which has since been integrated into the design of the <a href="../portfolio-item/product-details.html">Product Details Input Flow</a>.</p>
