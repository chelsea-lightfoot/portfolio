                <h2>A Work in Progress</h2>
                <p>I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons for a long while, and many times I've encountered the same scene. The players have just won a long battle and defeated many enemies, so they decide to see what items they can find as a reward - but the Game Master doesn't have any loot prepared! They then scramble to flip through their book in order to find the right tables to roll dice and determine random items for their group, but it is quite a lot of work to do in the moment.</p>
                <p>So I decided to solve this problem and create a fun item generator for Game Masters to use in a pinch to quickly pick out an item for their players. Taking inspiration from the popular Podcast "The Adventure Zone", I have begun illustrating a magical object that is a mix between a capsule machine and a crystal ball - hence the name "Oracle of Items".</p>
                <p>Phase 1 is to get the minimum viable product up and running. This includes: a web app set up to run through the wireflow below; completed illustrations for the Oracle, interface items, and the static background; and the backend data set for just the base set of magical items provided in the Dungeons and Dragons book. I am currently in the process of finishing the illustrations</p>

                <p>This project is slow going, as it uses almost all of the skills I have. Currently all I have completed is the line-art for the main illustration, and the wireflows for all four phases of the project.</p>

                <h2>Phase 2</h2>
                <img src="../resources/images/oracle/oracle-phase2.jpg">
                <p>Phase 2 will add a common item generator that will build a new item by pulling together values from various data tables. This phase will mainly focus on building the data tables and system for stitching the values to form a full item. The only additiona UI piece will be an extra "coin" button to choose this option over the previous set.</p>

                <h2>Phase 3</h2>
                <img src="../resources/images/oracle/oracle-phase3.jpg">
                <p>For those unfamiliar with Dungeons and Dragons, the characters being played have specific skills based on their "Class" and thus only some items will be useful to them. To better ensure a truly useful item is generated phase 3 will add the ability for the user to filter the potential items based on the "Class" of the character the item is meant for.</p>

                <h2>Phase 4</h2>
                <img src="../resources/images/oracle/oracle-phase4.jpg">
                <p>Phase 4 will allow users to create accounts so they can save their items for future access. An added feature will be to allow users to organize these saved items into "buckets" so they can group their items for easy searching. This will be the most difficult phase - as it requires skills I do not have. I plan to either learn the skills necessary, or to work with someone else who has them.</p>
