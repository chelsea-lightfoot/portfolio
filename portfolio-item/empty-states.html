        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>

            <p>When Inxeption customers first entered their newly created platforms all of the modules were empty, with no way to guide the customer to the area they needed to fill out. Though this spoke to a larger issue with platform onboarding, I was given the task to create a simple stop-gap design that would make the platform look less empty.</p>

        <section class="process">
            <h2>Process</h2>

            <!--<div id="process-gallery">-->
                <!--<div class="item-card item1"></div>-->
                <!--<div class="item-card item2"></div>-->
                <!--<div class="item-card item3"></div>-->
            <!--</div>-->

            <p>I was not given a lot of time for this project, and as I was also tasked with developing this project my manager encouraged me to bypass my usual sketches and go straight into design. Still I researched what other designers have done to get inspiration and understand what elements would be necessary. Even though these would be short-lived designs I wanted to be sure they were effective until a better system was implemented.</p>

        <section class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <div id="solution-gallery">
                <div class="item-card item1"></div>
                <div class="item-card item2"></div>
                <div class="item-card item3"></div>
            </div>

            <p>I kept the design simple, dashed lines to show the general shape of future data and help text to direct users to where they could start inputting the necessary data. The simple design made a quick development possible, and it also works well on mobile. The added buttons to make navigation to sections of the application helped ease the onboarding issues experienced by new customers. A better onboarding experience is now in the works.</p>
