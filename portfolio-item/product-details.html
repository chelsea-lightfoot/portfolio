        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>

            <p>Users were having a difficult time using the product module - a central part of the application that informs the rest of the system. The long list of form fields made it difficult for users to find where and what information they needed to enter to fill out their product. They were so overwhelmed by the long form that they often avoided using it all together. The page had grown crowded with functionality with no way to guide the user through all of the features of the module.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="process">
            <h2>Process</h2>

            <div id="process-gallery">
                <div class="item-card item1"></div>
                <div class="item-card item2"></div>
                <div class="item-card item3"></div>
            </div>

            <p>I immediately set up meetings with the customer success team to gather research about our user’s pain points. Through this I learned what parts of the form were required, which were the most used, and which were the most confusing.</p>

            <p>With this knowledge I then focused in on another major problem - lack of completion of the form. Users weren’t aware of the power of a complete product, nor that it was something they should strive for. A system to reward the user for filling out the product would be needed.</p>

            <p>Following a previous prototype from my team lead, I began planning how to better segment the form into pieces that were easier to navigate. I worked with product management to determine grouping of fields and the importance of them.</p>

            <p>During planning and design I discovered another issue - a product could have multiple different versions for the channels module of the product. It would be important to indicate which version of a product the user was editing and it would need to be easier for them to navigate between product versions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div id="solution-gallery">
                <div class="item-card item1"></div>
                <div class="item-card item2">
                    <!--PUT IN VIDEO-->
                </div>
                <div class="item-card item3"></div>
            </div>

            <p>My final design consisted of four main elements: the form separated into multiple sections, a sidebar navigation, a percentage of completion, and an auto-save feature.</p>

            <p>The sections immediately solved the issue of the longer form, and they would be more maintainable as we add function to the module. The customer success team was thrilled, it would be much easier to guide a new user through the system.</p>

            <p>The auto-save feature was added with the sections so that a user would not need to fear losing their changes between sections of the product. In the end engineering was unable to implement the auto-save feature, thus I quickly modified the action bar to indicate that saving was necessary before navigating away from the module.</p>

            <p>The sidebar not only helped navigate between sections, it added the ability for the user to move between versions of the product more smoothly. Adding the image at the top was more than a style choice - I put it there to encourage users to upload at least one image to their product so it could be better used for ecommerce.</p>

            <p>The final piece, the percentage of completion, was implemented to give users a goal to strive for in completing their product. Getting 100% is a tangible reward to encourage user behavior towards the product completion that will ultimately make them successful in the online marketplace in the future.</p>
