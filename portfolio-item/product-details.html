                <h2>Process</h2>

                <p>Users were having a difficult time using the product module &mdash; a central part of the application that populates the rest of the system. The long list of form fields made it difficult for users to find where and what information they needed to enter to fill out their product. They were so overwhelmed by the long form that they often avoided using it all together. The page had grown crowded with functionality with no way to guide the user through all of the features of the module.</p>

                                    fullscreen

                    <div class="item-card item3"></div>
            </div>

                <p>I immediately set up meetings with the customer success team to gather research about our users' pain points. Through these conversations I learned what parts of the form were required, which were the most used, and which were the most confusing.</p>

                <p>With this knowledge I then focused in on another major problem &mdash; lack of completion of the form. Users weren't aware of the power of a complete product, nor that it was something they should strive for. A system to encourage the user to fill out the product would be needed.</p>

                <p>Following a previous prototype from my team lead, I began planning how to better segment the form into pieces that were easier to navigate. I worked with our product management team to group the many form fields into new subpages based on priority and application.</p>

                <p>During planning and design I discovered another issue &mdash; a product could have multiple variants across the many integrations our service offered. It would be important to indicate which variant of a product the user was editing and it would need to be easier for them to navigate between those variants.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>

                <p>My final design consisted of four main elements: the form separated into multiple sections, a sidebar for navigation of those sections, an auto-save feature, and a percentage of completion for each section and the overall product.</p>

                <p>The sections immediately solved the issue caused by the longer form, and they would be more maintainable as we add function to the module. The customer success team was thrilled  it would be much easier to guide a new user through the system.</p>

                <p>The sidebar not only helped navigate between sections, it added the ability for the user to move between variants of the product more smoothly. Adding the image at the top was more than a style choice &mdash; I designed this element to encourage users to upload at least one image to better prepare their products for e-commerce.</p>

                <p>The auto-save feature was added with the sections so that a user would not need to fear losing their changes between sections of the product. Due to scheduling conflicts, engineering was unable to implement the auto-save feature. In response to this change of functionality, I quickly modified the action bar to indicate that saving was necessary before navigating away from the module.</p>

                <p>The final piece, the percentage of completion, was implemented to give users a goal to strive for in completing their product. Achieving a product completion score of 100% is a tangible reward which encourages users to make their products successful in the online marketplace.</p>

                <p>While producing this design from start to finish, I preformed several roles not seen in the finished product. I led several meetings with all stakeholders to present and refine the design as well as de-risk the implementation. I drafted thirteen pages of UX documentation to assist development in successfully completing the project. When our front-end development team ran short on time, I stepped in to implement the remaining features.</p>
