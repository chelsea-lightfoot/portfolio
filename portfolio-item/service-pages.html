                <h2>Problem</h2>

                <p>The Inxeption marketing team was excited to dogfood our product marketplace service as the means of selling all of Inxeption’s services to current and potential customers. Unfortunately, our marketplace was not SEO capable. None of our fairly unique products ranked well in search results, and our paid advertisements were not yielding conversions. Furthermore, most of our current customers had only purchased one of the many services Inxeption offered and had no resource or likelihood to learn about the other services we wanted to market to them.</p>

            </div>

                <h2>Process</h2>

                <p>We decided to create static product pages that were based on SEO necessities instead of what our product could currently generate on its own, with the hope that this design could be repurposed as a template for the dynamically generated products in the future.</p>

                <p>I organized a few meetings with our SEO marketing expert to learn what elements would be needed. Then I began sketching and sectioning out the features of the page so I could focus on each piece. I started with the product promotional text and cross-navigation that would go above the fold. This piece would inform the design for the rest of the project, so it was important to establish its layout before I continued with the SEO content below the fold.</p>

                <p>After sketching layouts I decided to convert them to wireframes so I could more easily ensure that I was including all of the elements we needed for these pages with the correct placement. After I had agreement from the team, my manager encouraged me to move straight to development of the pages.</p>

                <p>I developed the page template using my lead UX designer’s most recent organizational framework. After recreating the base layout from my wireframes I refined the page into a final design.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>

                <p>The main details of each service is placed above the fold with a left sidebar navigation to help users self-select into the product they are interested in. We decided to put the navigation explicitly in the page instead of in a dropdown to avoid hiding the breadth of what Inxeption offers. I stuck with a fairly simple design for these pages, focusing on typographical hierarchy to help viewers navigate the large amount of content without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

                <p>Leveraging my skills in user experience, I developed the first page as a robust template to be used for all future product pages. This included: using the Handlebars library to template out recurring blocks of code - specifically in the sidebar navigation; ensuring that the code was responsive; using JavaScript to create a dropdown menu that responded to the current page; and writing well-organized and readable code.</p>

                <p>I segmented the many pieces of the template into straight-forward tasks and easily hand off the rest of the implementation of this project to a new Web Dev hire. After guiding him through the initial template he was able to intuitively build the remaining pages needed for the first product push - and has been able to create new pages as they are needed.</p>
