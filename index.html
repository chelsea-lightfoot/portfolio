                <h2>Hi there! My name is Chelsea Lightfoot</h2>

                <p>A designer of many talents, through my career of designing for web applications I have found that I
                    excel at supporting developer efforts by taking their impressive work and turning it into an amazing
                    experience.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>

                <p>While I was studying Graphic Design at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, I befriended many people in the
                    computer science department. When I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in 2014, not only
                    did I have my knowledge of branding, web design, and print design, I also brought with me a strong
                    understanding of the software engineering process and the challenges developers face.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Experience</h2>

                <p>I quickly became fluent in HTML and CSS so I could better support my freelance work &mdash;
                    transferring those skills when I joined The Point Collective, a small design firm owned by veteran designers
                    Jaime Merz and Mandi Chase. Our main objective was to support small businesses in building and maintaining
                    an online presence &mdash; a complex process that I enjoyed simplifying through designing not only the
                    website itself, but the system the client used to update it as well. I took pride in empowering
                    clients to take their online presence into their own hands.</p>

                <p>After The Point Collective, I moved on to Inxeption as a UI/UX Designer where I have had the
                    privilege to design for the application since its <i>&mdash;ahem&mdash;</i> inception. For the last two years I
                    have been working to understand how to turn "boring" data entry and order tracking into a rewarding
                    experience that encourages customers to use the system to its fullest. I now lead all
                    design projects for our marketing team with a focus on the design of our website and how it
                    integrates with our system.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Personality</h2>

                <p>I also enjoy front end development and I am currently working towards true fluency with Javascript
                    and JQuery. I built this site from scratch! Check out my current project: <a href="https://github.com/chelsea-lightfoot/oracle-of-items">The Oracle of Items</a>.</p>

                <p>In my free time I like to listen to podcasts &mdash; the majority of which cover another pastime of
                    mine, Dungeons and Dragons. I play quite a few video games as not only do I enjoy the games themselves,
                    but I also I love to learn about the design that goes into making gameplay rewarding and fun. Outside of
                    the tech world I express my creativity with resin casting and wearing various Japanese street fashions.
                    I aspire to one day become a foster for cats and kittens in need, and to care for feral colonies that
                    need support.</p>
