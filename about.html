                <h2>Education</h2>

                <p>While I was studying Graphic Design at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, I befriended many people in the computer science department. When I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in 2014, not only did I have my knowledge of branding, web design, and print design, I also brought with me a strong understanding of the software engineering process and the challenges developers face.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>

                <p>I quickly became fluent in HTML and CSS so I could better support my freelance work &mdash;
                    transferring those skills when I joined
                    <a href="https://thepointcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Point Collective</a>, a small design firm owned by veteran designers Jaime Merz and Mandi Chase. Our main objective was to support small businesses in building and maintaining an online presence &mdash; a complex process that I enjoyed simplifying through designing not only the website itself, but the system our clients could use to update their content as well. I took pride in empowering clients to take their online presence into their own hands.
                </p>

                <p>After The Point Collective, I moved on to Inxeption as a UI/UX Designer where I have had the privilege to design for the application since its
                    <i>&mdash;ahem&mdash;</i> inception. For the last two years I have been working to understand how to turn "boring" data entry and order tracking into a rewarding experience that encourages customers to use the system to its fullest. I now lead all design projects for our marketing team with a focus on the design of our website and how it integrates with our industrial commerce ecosystem.

                <h2>Personality</h2>

                <p>I also enjoy front end development and I have become fluent in HTML, CSS / SASS, and Javascript / jQuery. I used those skills to build this website from scratch! I am currently working on a full web app project called the
                    <a href="portfolio-item/oracle-of-items.html">Oracle of Items</a> - check it out to see my process and progress.
                </p>

                <p>In my free time I like to listen to podcasts about true crime, comedy, and &mdash; another pastime of time &mdash; Dungeons and Dragons. I also play quite a few video games. Not only do I enjoy the games themselves, but I also love to learn about the design of rewarding gameplay mechanics. Outside of the tech world I express my creativity with resin casting and wearing various Japanese street fashions. I aspire to one day become a foster for cats and kittens in need, and to care for feral cat colonies in the Bay Area.</p>
